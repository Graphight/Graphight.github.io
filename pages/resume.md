# Resume

Having been on the hiring side of the table for so many years I grew tired of seeing the same hyper optimised style of resume.
I understand the purpose of that style is to process well in ATS systems and therefore it is a necessary evil to which I must comply.
That being said, I have also included a `Human Friendly` experimental option that I think flows nicer and tells a better story.
They should both contain the same information just formatted differently.
 
- [ATS Friendly (Plain Text)](../resources/Resume_ATS_Friendly.pdf)
- [Human Friendly (Narrative Style)](../resources/Resume_Human_Friendly.pdf)

If this experiment does not pan out then I will join the drudgery and only keep the plain text one.
