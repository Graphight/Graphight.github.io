# Publications

This is a list of publications that I have been involved in, either as an author or as a contributor.

1. [Robust changes to the wettest and driest days of the year are hidden within annual rainfall projections: a New Zealand case study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ad585a)\
Luke J Harringon, Suzanne M Rosier, **Tom I Marsh**, and Dave J Frame, 2024, *Environmental Research Letters*, 19, 074057

Currently, this list is small as my journey into academia is still in its early stages. I hope to add more in the future.
