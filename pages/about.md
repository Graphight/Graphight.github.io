# About

I am a Data Scientist currently working for Ströer Labs NZ, the development house for Ströer GmbH, a major online advertising platform in the German market. 
I am at my happiest when learning new things and deep diving into random topics with passionate individuals. 
I love problem solving and the challenge of breaking down complex topics into digestable chunks, naturaly, mentoring has been something that I have enjoyed picking up over the past few years taking on interns each summer and volunteering in the local community.

I am also currently pursuing a Master's of Physics at the University of Canterbury, working with the Atmospheric Science department, under the guidance of **Dave Frame** and **Suzanne Rosier**.

Before Ströer I worked for Foodstuffs South Island Ltd at their Christchurch based distribution centre, filling various roles such as forklift driver, supervisor, data analyst, and automation engineer. 
I was able to help improve operational efficiency enough for the warehouse to get international recognition, kickstarting my interest software and data driven processes.

In my limited spare time I enjoy escape rooms, hiking, playing and attempting to create video games, travelling, and consuming sci-fi media.
