# Home

Kia ora, welcome.

I am a Machine Learning Engineer with a physics background who has nearly a decade of experience building production systems at a TB/PB scale. 

Currently based in Boston, Massachusetts, I am originally from Christchurch, New Zealand.
Now that I am in New England, I aim to apply my skills to aerospace.
My specific fields of interest are; propulsion, space-manufacturing, space-mining, and in-situ resource utilization.
