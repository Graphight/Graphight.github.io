# Home

Kia ora, welcome.

I am a Machine Learning Engineer with a physics background and 8 years of experience building production systems at TB/PB scale. 

Originally from Christchurch, New Zealand, I'm now based in Boston, Massachusetts and want to apply my skills to aerospace: particularly propulsion, space manufacturing, mining, and in-situ resource utilization.
