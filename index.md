# Home

Kia ora, welcome.

I am a Machine Learning Engineer with a physics background who has years of experience building production systems at a TB/PB scale. 
I want to apply my skills to space, specifically in the sub-fields of propulsion, manufacturing, mining, and in-situ resource utilization.

Currently based in Boston, Massachusetts, I am originally from Christchurch, New Zealand.
